                <p>Assignment 1 was to employ fundamental data structures for effective data<br>management and to implement basic
                    sorting algorithms for sorting product data.<br><br>Assignment 2 was to gain a hands-on, in-depth understanding of sorting<br>algorithms, trace their execution and visualize
                    the sorting process.</p>
